# zero-to-hero-Data-Science-Project

This is The final project I field for my Data Science 101 course in my college. 

## Part 1: Scrapping 
in this section, we had to scrape hotels websites like Booking and Expedia 
we scrape them in the following way:
TTT - Time To Travel
LOS = Length Of Stay
we tried to get all the combinations of 1 to 5 nights for the next 30 days, and we did that for three different Time Stamps: 4/3/2023, 25/3/2023, 26/3/2023
for each one of the Hotels, we tried to get all the following data points:
Hotel name, various grades, number of stars/ratings, distance from the city center, room type, cancellation policy, price, etc.


## Part 2: Exploration & Data preprocessing
cleaning and organizing the data we got, created of the distributions of the price number, the hotel rating, the number of reviews, etc.

## Part 3: price forecasting 
We got a few models and ran them on the data, and tried to forecast the Prices of the hotels based on the features we got

## part 4: Price Differences Between Websites
we made join on the Expidia.csv and Booking.csv and took three single-valued values: Hotel Name, Check_in date, Cheack_out date
and try to see the difference between them 

## Part 5: Reverse Engineering
we tried here using the data we got to predict the location of each hotel on the website for each date
